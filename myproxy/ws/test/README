MyProxyWebService Unit Tests
============================
A test MyProxy server is needed for most of these tests.  Test MyProxyWebService
WSGI apps are created and queried by client calls in the tests.  The apps must
be configured to communicate with a backend MyProxy server.

This package contains three unit test modules:

1) test_httpbasicauth: test HTTP Basic Auth middleware used by the MyProxy
logon web service call.  The WSGI app is tested within Paste.fixture - i.e. no 
separate server process is started.  A Paste Deploy ini file httpbasicauth.ini,
configures the app.

2) test_myproxywsgi.py: test full MyProxy Web Service - logon and getTrustRoots
calls.  The WSGI app is tested within Paste.fixture.

3) test_myproxywsgi_with_paster.py: test full MyProxy Web Service running it
over SSL with paster.  The unit tests automatically start the app with paster 
running in a separate thread, closing it down when the test is finished.  The
tests call bash shell scripts myproxy-ws-logon.sh, myproxy-ws-get-trustroots.sh
must have execute permissions:

$ chmod 755 ./*.sh

The same Paste Deploy ini file myproxywsgi.ini, is used to configure the app
for 2) and 3).  Unit tests setting for 2) and 3) are in test_myproxywsgi.cfg
