# Path for logon requests
#
# The URI path or paths that will be matched to a logobn request.  Regular
# expression may be entered but typically only a single path would be expected
# for the logon request.  The format of this option is inherited from the more
# generic HTTP Basic Auth middleware which the MyProxyApp uses.

# MyProxy.client.* settings.  These refer to the set up of the MyProxyClient
# instance used by the middleware to talk to the backend MyProxy server

# fully qualified domain name or else set the MYPROXY_SERVER environment

# server that it fronts e.g. set to /etc/grid-security/certificates.  For these
