Description: Provides a simple web service interface to an online CA suitable for use as a
        SLCS (Short-Lived Credential Service).
        
        The interface is implemented as a WSGI application which fronts a Certificate
        Authority.  Web service call can be made to request a certificate.  The web 
        service interface is RESTful using GET and POST operations.  The service 
        should be hosted over HTTPS.  On the server-side, client authentication is 
        configurable to the required means.  This client uses  HTTP Basic Auth to pass 
        username and pass-phrase credentials
        
        Client scripts are available which need no specialised installation or 
        applications, only openssl and wget or curl which are typically available on 
        Linux/UNIX based systems.
